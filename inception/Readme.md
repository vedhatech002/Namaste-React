## Important notes

> most costliest expensive thing in browser webpage is dom nodes needs to be manipulated put some nodes to dom removing some nodes from dom.All the framework and libraries are trying to optimize this. React is also comes with philosphy of writing or manipulating the dom using javasript.

## Assignments

- What is Emmet?

> Emmet is a plugin or developer tool kit that helps make your work faster and substantially enhances workflows.It automatically generates syntax of code.

- Difference between a Library and Framework?

> The main difference between frameworks and libraries is that libraries are reusable chunks of code that you can call upon in your own code, while frameworks provide an overall structure for your code. library are can be used in existing project or where we want to use in app. framework didn't work like that with this we create whole app.

- What is CDN? Why do we use it?

  > A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. it contains a the set of code in that server we don't need to install dependencies to use that code, we can easily use it by calling that cdn in our web page.

- Why is React known as React?

> It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage.

- What is crossorigin in script tag?

> The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

-What is diference between React and ReactDOM?

> eact provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment.

-What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

> The development version (react. development. js) provides more detailed error messages and warnings compared to the production version.

> production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

- What is async and defer?

> Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
